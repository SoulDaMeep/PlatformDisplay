## Why doesnt it line up?
Display Scale in the interface settings of rocketleague is not supported in the sdk. only works on 100% Display Scale and will need further testing once it is added.
Interface Scale should be 90% or lower, 90+ is not linear to the rest.

Interface Scale: 90%

Display Scale: 100%

## "Ghost Players" / Start of game sorting
Both fixed.
Please contact me if you would like to learn how we fixed these issues.
