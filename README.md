# PlatformDisplay

plugin id: 376

I will come back to this plugin to make it more user friendly, also fixing any bugs that might appear through the journey of this plugin. Please notify me if there is any bugs on Discord: SOul#7423

Issues that we know of:
1. When players leave, the entire display can get messed up or "shifted". As of right now, this is not something we can fix.
2. At the start of the game or when players have the same score, the display will not show the platforms in correct order corresponding to each user on the leaderboard, this is because we dont quite know how the leader board sorts the players. It will get accurate once players start getting points/score. Once we understand how the leaderboard sorts players, this will definetly be fixed.
