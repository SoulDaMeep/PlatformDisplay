#### Issues:
## "Ghost Players"
<p>
When a player leaves, their username might stay on the scoreboard as a dimmed-out version of their user; we We like to call these "Ghost Players". Unfortunately, this issue has caused significant problems in our plugin, as the leaving of a player messes up the entire scoreboard and disrupts its alignment. We don't know when a player leaves whether or not the scoreboard will keep the user as a Ghost Player, but we can take data from RocketLeague itself to decide whether or not the player will stay as a Ghost Player.
